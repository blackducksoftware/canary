# stay tuned
Source code will be available for this project on November 16, 2017.  We are in the process of testing that the first commit's basic functionality is completely indepenedent of any blackduck specific elements.

## canary
Canary is a metrics and metadata exporter that runs in any cloud native environment to help you embed SLO's into your microservice application bundles.


## development policy
Canary embraces the traditional values of open source projects in the Apache and CNCF communities, and embraces ideas and community over the code itself.  Please create an issue or better yet, submit a pull request if you have any suggestions around metrics or checks that you think will be generically useful to organizations that ship code which is meant to run in a microservice environment.

## golang standards
We follow the same standards for golang as are followed in the moby project, the kubernetes project, and other major golang projects.  We embrace modern golang idioms including usage of viper (for config), glide (for dependencies), and aim to stay on the 'bleeding edge', since, after all, we aim to always deploy inside of containers.
